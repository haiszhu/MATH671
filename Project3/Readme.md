# project 3, Fast Gaussian Transformation in 2D

In fact, there shouldn't be two much difference between 2D and 3D data. That is something could be working on.
It is running smoothly, but it do need much more work to be applied to more general case.

Another thing could improve is to define wave to local interaction list. 

And last but not least, sweeping algorithm.
