# project 2 on application of nonuniform fft (far from complete)

The main issue as of right now is the convergence of singular integral on polar coordinates, 
which should be exponential according to * [BIEforElliptic.pdf](ying2006h3b.pdf)
But according to * [Trapezoid.pdf](trap_conv.pdf) after polar transformation, |r| is really
an issue since the derivative is discontinuous around 0.
